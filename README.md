## Introduction About Project:

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.

Routing is Also added:

The project demonstrates the use of two form types: 
   1. Template-Driven Forms 
   2. Reactive Forms in Angular. 
   
It includes form handling, data binding, and validation for both types.

## Features:

Template-Driven and Reactive Forms implementation.
Form validation with different types of validation (required fields, email pattern, custom validation).
Routing: Navigate between the Home page and Registration page via a navigation menu in the header.
Header Navigation: Contains links to the Home and Registration components.
Custom Styling:
    Form styles are written inside the styles.css.
    Navbar styles are located in the app.component.css.

## Routing:

Header contains links to navigate between:
    Home: The main page of the application.
    Registration: Page with the form (template-driven or reactive).

## Validation:

Both Template-Driven and Reactive Forms include validation for fields like required inputs, email formats, and custom validation.
Error messages are shown when form controls are invalid, guiding the user to correct the input.
